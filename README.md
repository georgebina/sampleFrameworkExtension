Sample Framework Extension
==========================

This project shows how you can dramatically improve the authoring experience with a simple DITA framework extension.

It features:
- CSS customization
- Adding new actions on the toolbar
- Restricting the DITA vocabulary without schema specialization
- Schematron checks with quick-fixes

This repository contains the code used for [these slides](http://www.slideshare.net/IXIASOFT/maximize-your-oxygen-usage-oxygen-xml-syncro-soft).
